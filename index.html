        <h2>A Message From Me</h2>
        <p>Hello Roshni,

I know I have done things that might have hurt you a lot, but there‚Äôs one thing I want you to know: I truly feel bad for everything I've done to you. I am sorry for each and every one of my actions. I understand that "sorry" won‚Äôt fix things, but I just wanted to say it.

In these two days where we haven‚Äôt spoken a single word, I‚Äôve felt lost and broken. I say I don‚Äôt care, but that‚Äôs not the truth‚ÄîI care a lot. Every single minute since we stopped talking has been hurting me and making me regret not stopping you from leaving.

I am here to express what I‚Äôm feeling and to tell you that I love you and I do care. I know you might not believe me because I‚Äôve been treating you as if I don‚Äôt care or love you anymore, but I don‚Äôt know why I did that. I am sorry for everything.

Remembering the old days still brings me comfort, and it felt loved back then. I don't know how things turned negative, and now we are strangers. I know I am responsible for everything that happened.

Anyway, I just wanted to express my feelings right now, and I don‚Äôt expect anything from you. Thank you for reading this. Just know one thing: I love you, I will love you, and I will never, ever forget you because you made me the person I am today‚Äîthe person who went from being lonely, sad, and running from reality, to the happiest I‚Äôve ever been. You helped me so much in my life.

The last thing I want to say is that I still love you, and I can‚Äôt imagine life without you ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
